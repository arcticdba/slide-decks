# slide-decks

In this repository you will find all slide decks and possible additional material for sessions presented at various events around the world. Folders are organized by year and event. Every event folder is setup as follows; YYYY-MM-DD_EventName_Location. Location could either be online or the on site location where the event was hosted.

In case you want to know more about the sessions, looking for session abstracts or my speaker profile, please find my [Sessionize profile](https://sessionize.com/alexanderarvidsson).

All material is created by myself, or otherwise refered to original owners of material. Scripts and demo files can be reused for own non-comercial purposes, with reference to the original creator. For further questions, please reach out by creating an issue.
